      {
        "q": "What is TattooMate?",
        "a": "TattooMate is a web-based solution for digital consent forms, health information and signatures in tattoo and piercing studios."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does it run on phone & tablet?",
        "a": "Yes. TattooMate is fully web-based and optimized for touch. Customers don’t need to install an app. A modern browser and the phone camera are enough."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do customers get to the forms?",
        "a": "Simply via QR code. The code is generated in the admin area and can be posted in the studio or shown on a tablet. Customers scan it and go directly to the right form."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do we need additional devices?",
        "a": "No, additional devices aren’t strictly required. However, we recommend one or two tablets (even inexpensive ones), connected to the studio Wi-Fi. That way customers can fill out forms without using their own mobile data. This is especially handy when a touch-up requires an additional signature."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is there a limit on the number of artists?",
        "a": "No. TattooMate is licensed per studio. You can create as many artists as you want without the price changing."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is event or convention mode extra?",
        "a": "No. Event and convention mode are always included and can be used when needed."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I separate studio and conventions?",
        "a": "Yes. Via the event/convention mode with its own capture and separate overview."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does under-18 really work?",
        "a": "If a customer is below the minimum age, parent fields, signatures and required uploads become mandatory. Nothing is submitted without these required fields."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I generate PDFs again later?",
        "a": "Yes. The studio can regenerate, print or save PDFs anytime in the admin."
      },
      {
        "q": "Who can access customer data?",
        "a": "Only authorized studio users. TattooMate uses roles and permissions so not everyone can see or edit everything."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is TattooMate legally safe?",
        "a": "TattooMate helps you document consent, signatures and health information cleanly. It does not replace legal advice, but it creates traceable and reproducible workflows."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is TattooMate GDPR-compliant?",
        "a": "Yes. No IDs or PDFs are sent by email. Documents are generated and stored in the admin area. ID images are stored separately from forms and are not directly attributable. The data remains fully under your control."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is there newsletter / opt-in?",
        "a": "Yes, optional. The newsletter is only enabled if the customer explicitly agrees in the form (checkbox) and signs the consent. Unsubscribe is always possible; timestamp and source of consent are documented."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is the newsletter system GDPR-compliant?",
        "a": "Yes. Customers decide during the form whether they want newsletter updates. An unsubscribe link can be included in newsletters and should be sent with each campaign."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I host TattooMate myself?",
        "a": "Yes. You can run TattooMate on your own server or use hosting by TattooMate. Both options are clearly defined and transparently priced."
      },
      {
        "q": "What does SaaS mean?",
        "a": "SaaS stands for Software as a Service. That means: you use the software over the internet without installing or operating it yourself. Maintenance and updates are handled by the provider."
      },
      {
        "q": "Are there hidden costs or additional fees?",
        "a": "No. All prices are fixed. There are no usage-based fees, no hidden surcharges and no negotiations."
      },
      {
        "q": "Why TattooMate — and why maybe not?",
        "a": "You shouldn’t use TattooMate if you’re just looking for any form. It’s for studios that want clean documentation, simple workflows and GDPR-aware handling — which often saves time and money."
      },
      {
        "q": "Why is there a demo if prices are fixed?",
        "a": "The demo isn’t for price negotiations. It’s to show the workflow, answer questions and make sure TattooMate fits your studio."

    "title": "Why TattooMate exists",
    "lead": "TattooMate wasn’t created because I wanted to build “just another software”. It was created because I saw how much studio life is weighed down by paper, stress and unnecessary work.",
    "p1": "The personal trigger was pretty simple — and exactly because of that, obvious: my wife works in a tattoo and piercing studio.",
    "p2": "And I experienced what that means day to day. Printing consents again and again. Stapling. Punching. Having customers fill them out. Filing them afterwards. And not once a day, but constantly — always when more important things should be happening.",
    "p3": "For me it was immediately clear: this isn’t just",
    "callout": "“a bit of admin. It’s a process that eats time every single day — for something that can be solved cleanly with technology.”",
    "h2_1": "What really bothered me about it",
    "p4": "First, it’s unnecessary work. Not in the sense of “people are lazy”, but in the sense of: it’s manual labor simply because it’s always been done that way.",
    "p5": "Second, it creates paper waste for years. Many of these documents have to be stored for a long time — which means stacks, folders, storage space. For something that really just needs to be documented securely.",
    "p6": "Third, it gets really painful when it comes to claims: when a request comes in and you need that one specific consent, it often turns into a search mission that realistically nobody enjoys — and that can go wrong under stress. You’re not looking for “a document”, you’re looking for a tiny sheet in years of paper archives.",
    "h2_2": "Why existing solutions didn’t fit for me",
    "p7": "Of course, there are digital alternatives. Some are technically well built and look modern.",
    "p8": "What bothered me wasn’t so much the tech, but the orientation: many solutions are designed as platforms. Data sits externally, processes are predefined, and studios have to adapt — not the other way around.",
    "p9": "On top of that, feature bundles are useful for some studios but not for others. Calendars, CRM or marketing features are often baked in, even if they’re not needed day to day.",
    "p10": "A real option to self-host and keep full control over data was missing for me. With sensitive information and GDPR-relevant data, that isn’t a side note — it’s decisive.",
    "h2_3": "What TattooMate was actually built for",
    "p11": "At the start, TattooMate wasn’t a business. That matters to me. I didn’t build it to “enter the market” or to spin up a SaaS.",
    "p12": "I built it to take that work off my wife’s shoulders. And as a bonus goal: less paper waste. More sustainability, without the studio having to fight for it.",
    "p13": "Only when other studios asked if they could use it too did it slowly become a product. Not planned. Not the focus. More like: “Okay — if this helps multiple studios, we’ll do it properly.”",
    "h2_4": "The mindset behind it",
    "p14": "TattooMate should be a tool. Not a data collector. Not a calendar requirement. Not a system that forces studios into a platform.",
    "p15": "It’s about clean proof, less stress in daily work, and real control over your own data. If that sounds like you, TattooMate fits.",
    "p16": "That applies here too — so no cookie banner is needed.",
    "outro": "If you’re just looking for any online form, TattooMate probably isn’t the right tool.",
    "outro2": "But if you want a solution that takes studio life seriously and doesn’t follow Silicon-Valley logic, TattooMate fits.",
